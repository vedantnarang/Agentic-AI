#object has 3 parts identity ,value and type
#if an object is mutable or immutable it can be checked with the help of identity only 

#proof that sugar_amount is called by reference

print(f"identity of 2 is :{id(2)}")
print(f"identity of 12 is:{id(12)}")

print(f"id of sugar_amount :{id(sugar_amount)}")
